# Code Quizjr

## Description

In this project we create a quiz based on JavaScript basics. Most of our code is done with JavaScript which allows the user to interact with the window and select answers to each question of the quiz. We also give them the ability to input their initials and save their scores. This challenge allowed us to continue learning about JavaScript and its many functions.
